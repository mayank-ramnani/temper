Compiler Hardening for C/C++ based on the [OpenSSF Compiler Hardening Guide](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++.html)

## Usage
Run this in your build environment, otherwise might give inaccurate results due to compiler being different than the one used in production
`python3 main.py --makefile <path-to-project-makefile>`
